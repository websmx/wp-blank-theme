# wp-blanktheme
A completely BLANK WordPress "theme" to use with Oxygen Builder. After installation and activation delete all other themes. This theme will never need to be updated.

**NOTE:** Since Oxygen Builder **disables** the theme, you must add functions using a plugin. 

Consider these options:

1. Code Snippets (https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)
2. Advanced Scripts (https://www.cleanplugins.com/products/advanced-scripts/)
3. Scripts Organizer (https://docs.dplugins.com/scripts-organizer/scripts-organizer/)

To install:
1. Download the wp-blanktheme.zip file.
2. In WordPress, go to **Appearance > Themes** and click "Add New", then "Upload Theme".
3. Add the **wp-blanktheme.zip** file and click "Install Now." Activate the Theme.
4. Delete all other themes (to reduce any need for updates)
5. Enjoy!

No support is provided for this theme. I don't think you will need any. ;)
