# wp-blanktheme
A completely BLANK WordPress "theme" to use with Oxygen Builder. After installation and activation delete all other themes. This theme will never need to be updated.

Since Oxygen Builder **disables** the theme, you must add functions using a plugin. Consider these options:

1. Code Snippets (https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/)
2. Advanced Scripts (https://www.cleanplugins.com/products/advanced-scripts/)
3. Scripts Organizer (https://docs.dplugins.com/scripts-organizer/scripts-organizer/)

No support is provided for this theme. I don't think you will need any. ;)
